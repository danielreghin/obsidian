## Feedback - Things to work on

### Formal Feedback
- Passive Voice:
	- The focus is on the action rather than the person doing it. 
	- A common mistake is saying 'The manager completed the report,' which is active. In passive voice, it becomes 'The report was completed by the manager.' 
- Future continuous tense:
	- We use it to describe actions that will be happening at a certain time in the future. 
	- A common mistake is to forget to use 'will be' before the '-ing' form of the verb.  
	- Instead of saying 'I will visit the museum,',  You would say 'I will be visiting the museum.'
- Intensifiers
	- Use more 'absolutely', 'completely', and 'totally', 'effectively'
	- These words make your statement stronger. 
	- For instance, instead of saying 'I am happy', you can say 'I am absolutely happy'. A common mistake is to use the same intensifier all the time, so try to vary them.
- Reported speech. 
	- This is when you tell someone what another person said.
	- A common mistake is keeping the same tense as the original sentence. For example, if someone says 'I am happy,' in reported speech, you would say 'He said he was happy.' Notice how 'am' changes to 'was' in the past tense.
- Question tags
	- are short questions added to the end of a sentence. 
	- They are used to confirm information. A common mistake is using the wrong tense, like saying - 'You are coming tomorrow, do you?' instead of 'You are coming tomorrow, aren't you?'
