## Grammatical Construction
- **Passive Voice:** Focus on the action. "The report was completed by the manager" instead "The manager completed the report". 
- **Intensifiers:** Intensify sentences. Use 'absolutely', 'completely', and 'totally', 'effectively'.

- **Question Tags:** Short questions added to the end of a sentence. 'You are coming tomorrow, aren't you?' instead of 'You are coming, do you?'

- Something is difficult:  
	- I had **too much** coffee. I have **too much** to do. It´s **too hard** to do. I have **too much baking to do**. It´s too **hard to choose**.
- Something is easy: 
	- That´s **easy enough**. Call my boss is **easy enough to do**. That dessert is **easy enough to make**.
- Say something is greater than very: 
	- You can say **such** (to noun) or **so** (to adjective and adverb)  ex: It was **such a** great **night**. I was **so happy**.
- Polite questions: 
	- You begin the question with **can, will, could, or would**.
### Good suggestions
- During a conversation say: "I see" or "Absolutely" to agree with what a person is saying. 
- You can say "Exactly" to confirm that the person got what you are saying. 
- Use more adverbs:  'absolutely', 'completely', and 'totally'
