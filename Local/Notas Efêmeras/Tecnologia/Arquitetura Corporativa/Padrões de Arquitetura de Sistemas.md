Over the last several years we’ve seen a whole range of ideas regarding the architecture of systems. These include:

- [Hexagonal Architecture](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture) (a.k.a. Ports and Adapters) by Alistair Cockburn and adopted by Steve Freeman, and Nat Pryce in their wonderful book [Growing Object Oriented Software](http://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627)
- [Onion Architecture](http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/) by Jeffrey Palermo
- [Screaming Architecture](http://blog.cleancoders.com/2011-09-30-Screaming-Architecture) from a blog of mine last year
- [DCI](http://www.amazon.com/Lean-Architecture-Agile-Software-Development/dp/0470684208/) from James Coplien, and Trygve Reenskaug.
- [BCE](http://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Software-Engineering-Approach/dp/0201544350) by Ivar Jacobson from his book _Object Oriented Software Engineering: A Use-Case Driven Approach_
